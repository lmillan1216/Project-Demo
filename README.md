# Project-Demo
This is a small project that shows my understanding of HTML, CSS, JS , and how to fetch data from an API and display it.
The API being used for this project is https://openweathermap.org/.
Please download the files to a code editor and run them. 
You should be able to add in a city and it will display the current weather.
I have provided a screenshot that displays the input and output.
